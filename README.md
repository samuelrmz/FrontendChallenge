# FrontendChallenge - Samuel Ramirez M

Swag Labs - 10 test scenarios automated with all bonuses: code source inside src/ folder.

*Note: Add-Remove task - TODOIST.zip file contains the flow to add and remove items in TodoIst webpage, this flow was not completed in class and instructor mentioned we could get extra bonus if we're able to complete it. My extra mile.
